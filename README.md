# Autonomous-agents-in-Snake-game-using-Deep-Reinforcement-learning

This project involves training an agent to play the classic snake game autonomously.  In this project, I employed a convolutional neural network (CNN)
trained with a variant of Q-learning. Also, instead of single experience replay, I used dual experience replay to distinguish between positive reward and negative
reward yielding experiences. 

The snake game has been programmed using Pygame library from scratch and the agent would be trained on the same. Currently, the project is under traning. Thank you.
